# **Lumora** - Connect with Like-Minded People at Events 🎉

## **Inspiration** 💡  
We love attending events, but finding someone to share the experience with isn’t always easy. Lumora was created to help you connect with others who share the same interests. It's a simple and fun way to find your people for any event. 🤝

## **What It Does** 🌟  
Lumora makes it easy to discover and connect with people who are excited about the same events as you. Whether it’s a concert 🎶, sports game 🏟️, or any other event 🎭, Lumora allows you to explore upcoming events and find others to enjoy them with. Just a few taps, and you’re connected. 📲

## **How We Built It** 🛠️  
We built **Lumora** as a cross-platform mobile app using the following tools:

- **Expo Router** and **Tamagui** for a seamless and modern user experience. 💻
- **MongoDB Atlas** for storing event data and user information. 📊
- **Semantic search** capabilities to intelligently match users with events they are most interested in. 🔍

These technologies allowed us to create a fast, interactive, and user-friendly app. 🚀

## **Challenges We Ran Into** ⚡
